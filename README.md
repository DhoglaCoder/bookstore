This is my first mern stack project that was created using tutorials on Youtube.
It is made using vite+react in frontend with daisyUi plugin and node and express in backend.
There were two local databases created on mangoDB with names as "user" and "books".

It consists of signup , login , home and course pages.

It is still not completed and needs cart page and order page to be developed.
